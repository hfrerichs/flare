FLARE - Field Line Analysis and Reconstruction Environment
==========================================================


Installation:
-------------

Generate a configuration file with the following command (running "./configure.sh --help" will list optional arguments):

	./configure.sh

Then compile and install the code using:

	make
	make install




Requirements:
-------------

-FGSL (FORTRAN interface to the GNU Scientific Library)
-GSL (GNU Scientific Library): make sure you have 'libgsl0-dev' installed as well




How to use FLARE:
-----------------

Execute "run_flare.sh" in your working directory. Required input files are:

	bfield.conf	defines the magnetic configuretion

	boundary.conf	defines the plasma boundary (divertor elements, limiters, main chamber, ...)

	run.conf	defines which sub-programs to run and allows to set input parameter




Parallelization:
----------------

Parallelization is supported for all magnetic field configurations except those based on M3D-C1 data.
Parallelization is implemented in the following tools:
-connection_length
-field_line_loss
-melnikov_function
-poincare_plot
-safety_factor
-sample_bfield
-separatrix_manifolds
-transform_to_flux_coordinates




Notes for particular architectures:
-----------------------------------
CHTC: load modules
  1) compile/intel             2) mpi/intel/openmpi-1.6.4
local installation of FGSL:
	-set PKG_CONFIG_PATH for compilation of FLARE
	-set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for execution of FLARE
